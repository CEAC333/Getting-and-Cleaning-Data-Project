This is the information that is described in the Codebook that is used 
for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project. This section is going to define the elements that are used below to get the tidy data used from 
the tables and attachements on the code. 


## Variables and Measurements are defined below:
+ mean(): Mean value
+ std(): Standard deviation
+ mad(): Median absolute deviation 
+ max(): Largest value in array
+ min(): Smallest value in array
+ sma(): Signal magnitude area
+ energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
+ iqr(): Interquartile range 
+ entropy(): Signal entropy
+ arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
+ correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
+ maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
+ meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
+ skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
+ kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
+ bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of   the FFT of each window.
+ angle(): Angle between to vectors.


## Signals defined for getting the axial signals:
+ tBodyAcc-XYZ
+ tGravityAcc-XYZ
+ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+ tBodyGyro-XYZ
+ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
+ tBodyAccMag
+ tGravityAccMag

+ fBodyGyroJerkMag

## Additional Vectors that are listed:
+ gravityMean 
+ tBodyAccMean
+ tBodyAccJerkMean
+ tBodyGyroMean

+ 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
+ 4 SITTING
+ 5 STANDING
+ 6 LAYING
