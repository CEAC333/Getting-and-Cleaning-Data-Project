# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Project


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

In this repository, you will find the following files:
+ Readme.md, which details the items in the repository
+ R script called Run_Analysis.R, which details the code for getting the data
+ Codebook which describes all the data codes used, variables, and transformations that are used to perform the data cleaning process
+ Summary_data_tidy_data_set file, which shows all the data sets from the R script
